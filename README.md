# Interview Question

 # 01- Event Loop
  it enables asynchronous programming and ensures non-blocking execution.
 the event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and call stack

# 02- working of event loop  - call Stack , Web API,  Callback Queue , Event Loop
The Call Stack runs all synchronous code.
Web APIs handle asynchronous operations (timers, events, etc.) and move callbacks into appropriate queues once they finish.
The Event Loop ensures that the Microtask Queue is processed before the Task Queue, and tasks are moved to the call stack when it's empty.

# 03 Temporal Dead Zone
the period of time in JavaScript where a variable is declared using let or const, but it can't be accessed yet.it will throw a ReferenceError.

# 04 Lexical Scope
 Variables in inner functions can access variables in outer functions because of the structure of the code, not because of runtime behavior.

 # 05 Var, Let & Const
              Var                              let                             const
    Define in function scope             Block scope                          Block scope
    hoisting is possble                  possible in temeperal dead zone
    re-assign value and re-declare       re-assign value but not re-declare in same  not allowed re-assign and re-declare
    


# 06 Callback
A callback is a function that is passisng function as a argument and it is executed after the completiotion of outer function. 
Callback oftenly used in asyncronous programing .

# Strict Mode
Strict mode is design to help for developer to write better code React application.
when we wrap component it give warning like deprecated api and side effect in render phases

## 1. Introduction to Your Experience
I have over 2 years of experience in UI development.
I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly web applications using Modern JavaScript,
React, and HTML/CSS.

Iâ€™ve worked with Material-UI for creating responsive,
and have experience with Next.js for building server-side rendered and static websites.

In React, I have worked on  functional components, state and props management, hooks (like useState, useEffect),
React Router for navigation, and Context API for state management.
I also frequently integrate APIs using fetch and axios to handle data fetching and asynchronous operations.

Additionally, I have some exposure to cloud services such as Azure and AWS, which has helped me understand how to deploy and manage applications in cloud environments.

I have worked on Modern Javascript, and  React along with Html, Css and Material Ui.
I have also worked with next js i.e React framework that provide server-side rendering and static websites.
In React i have used functional component , state and prps, Hooks, react router, context api, Api calling using fetch and axios
i have aslo little knowledge of azure an aws services.

 In my recent project,I worked on a case study app.
The project aimed to streamline customer interaction by providing instant response through a chatbot and reducing wait times. 

where my role is responsible for designing and implementing the user interface. This includes creating resuable components for chat message , input field ,filter dropdown and buttons. I have used hooks  for state mangement ,  Axois for calling api , and creating a dropdown to refine the search .

So here we have used React, JavaScript, Html, Css, Material Ui for frontend part and for backend we have used Python and we deployed project on Azure cloud.

 in my prevoius client project for an e-commerce platform . I developed a dynamic table that displayed data from a backend api, I created the table component to map through the recieve data . One challenged I faced was rendering large datasets , Which I addressed by implementing pagination.
